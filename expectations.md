### History

This con was born from BarCampCanberra, a sort of ‘*un*conference’. BarCamps are participatory conferences about web-stuff, put simply. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp):

> BarCamp is an international network of user-generated conferences primarily focused around technology and the web. They are open, participatory workshop-events, the content of which is provided by participants. The first BarCamps focused on early-stage web applications, and were related to open source technologies, social software, and open data formats.

But why *BarCamp*? In short, a few years ago now a well-known web industry publishing company started hosting an invitation-only web conference titled 'Foo Camp', which, with some playful allusion to the programmer slang term [foobar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foobar), spawned the all-public *Bar*Camp.

People worldwide were free to copy the name and conference model, giving rise to a range of odd, but entirely fair questions, including:

- **What?!** -- you want to hold a *booze conference* at a public library!?
- Will people be sleeping over...?
- So you can assure us there won't be a piss-up on premises, right?

(This is what contributed to the name change.)

## Recording the day

**Important:** The conference is a fairly photo-friendly event. It’s very likely that you will have your photo taken during the day; if you run a session, your photo will almost certainly be taken.

If you *don’t* wish to have your photo taken that is no problem. Keep an eye out for cameras and just let the person with the camera know. If you see a photo of yourself posted online you can ask the photographer to take it down if you wish.

If you do take photos you are welcome to add them to [the BarCampCanberra flickr group](http://www.flickr.com/groups/barcampcanberra/).

Talks may be recorded for posterity. If you really want your talk recorded, check what gear is in the room you are using.

If you use a slide deck, you might like to share it on Slideshare or a similar service after the event. You should bring your slide deck on a USB drive or better yet, a laptop.
