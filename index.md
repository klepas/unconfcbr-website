Welcome to the *un:Conference Canberra*, brought to you by some of the previous BarCampCanberra unorganisers, as well as fresh blood entirely.

## 411

Formerly `BarCampCanberra`, 2016 sees the return of a BarCamp-web-themed, participatory (un)conference.

As the unorganisers met early this year and after some initial chats, it was decided to mix things up for 2016: we're dropping the 'BarCamp' name.

Given the name change is primarily concerned with avoiding confusion, thematically not much has changed: the 'unconference' origins of the con aren't going anywhere --- in fact we renamed the conference to emphasise the participatory style BarCamp is so well known for.
