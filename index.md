Welcome to the *Un:Conference Canberra*, brought to you by some of the previous BarCampCanberra unorganisers, as well as fresh blood entirely. Woo!

## It's all in a name

The unorganisers met early this year and after some initial chats, it was decided to mix things up for 2016: we're dropping the 'BarCamp' name.

What? Why? And what is a 'BarCamp' anyway? From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp):

> BarCamp is an international network of user-generated conferences primarily focused around technology and the web. They are open, participatory workshop-events, the content of which is provided by participants. The first BarCamps focused on early-stage web applications, and were related to open source technologies, social software, and open data formats.

But why *BarCamp*? In short, a few years ago now a well-known web industry publishing company started hosting an invitation-only web conference titled 'Foo Camp', which, with some playful allusion to the programmer slang term [foobar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foobar), spawned the all-public *Bar*Camp.

People worldwide were free to copy the name and conference model, giving rise to a range of odd, but entirely fair questions, including:

- **What?!** -- you want to hold a *booze conference* at a public library!?
- Will people be sleeping over...?
- So you can assure us there won't be any piss-up on premises, right?

## So what is the diff?

Given the name change is primarily concerned with avoiding confusion, thematically not much has changed: the 'unconference' origins of the con aren't going anywhere --- in fact we renamed the conference to emphasise the participatory style BarCamp is so well known for.

As ‘unorganisers’ we provide a venue and a few other logistical necessities, but the *content* of the con is entirely organised on the day, and conducted by you --- the participants.

Topics? Besides wanting to pay homage to our roots (an open, accessible Internet, by and for its users and creators), we encourage you to present what you're passionate about.
