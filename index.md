Welcome to the *un:Conference Canberra*, brought to you by some of the previous BarCampCanberra unorganisers, as well as fresh blood entirely.

## 411

Formerly ‘BarCampCanberra’, 2016 sees the return of a barcamp-web-themed, participatory (un)conference.

The unorganisers met early this year and after some initial chats, it was decided to mix things up for 2016: we're dropping the 'BarCamp' name.

The name change is primarily concerned with avoiding confusion, and so thematically not much has changed. The 'unconference' origins of the con aren't going anywhere --- in fact we renamed the conference to emphasise the participatory style barcamps are so well known for.
