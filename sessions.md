We intend to offer all sessions that were reported and placed online in a full index here when Pascal:

1. finds a way of getting wp content of youtube-hosted talks & related meta into a jekyll collection (or via `_data`)
2. finishes the template
3. sets about doing the session index and then session item styling

Then this can be removed. :>
