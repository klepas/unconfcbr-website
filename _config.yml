# Collections
# Here we are going to define some Jekyll `Collections`.
# The feature is not fully stable, but mostly in order.
# Documentation is at:
# https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/

# This feature is used to generate the index of sessions for each year.
# The variables should be fairyl self-evident...
# The `youtube-playlist` is the playlist ID we want to embed, e.g., see:
# https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRvXbUtKWLiALD9MftfecWep04SjsNhS9
